Quick start
==================================
django-dynamic-map-borinud adds to the project the following views:
    * /dynamic/map/
    * /dynamic/extract-grib/

Map '/dynamic/map/'
-------------------
| This page is used to search for data through filters that show all the combinations present in the database.
| Once the search has been carried out, the data will be shown on the map through clusters, and can be filtered by attributes and by time.

Extract grib '/dynamic/extract-grib/'
-------------------------------------
This page allows you to download grib from the arkimet repository to your local repository.
